% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle
%In this paper we propose an unsupervised representation method (TS-LDDMM) to analyze inter-individual variability of time series dataset.
    %Inspired by the shape analysis literature, we extend Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) to time series, considering the temporal evolution as their distinctive feature.  
    % Given a dataset of $N$ individual's time series $(s^j)_{j\in[N]}$,
    %  we learn a time series of reference $\mathbf{s}_0$ encoding the common part of the individuals as well as diffeomorphisms $(\phi^j)_{j\in[N]}$ encoding the specificities of each individual:
    %  $s^j$ is seen as the transformation of $\mathbf{s}_0$ by $\phi_j$.
    %  Then, the parameters $(\alpha_j)_{j\in[N]}$ encoding the diffeomorphisms $(\phi^j)_{j\in[N]}$ are used as the features representation related to each time series $s^j$.
    %At the crossroads between URL for time series and shape analysis. %the algorithm extends the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) to the case of time series. This extension is a nontrivial application of the LDDMM framework since it involves applying deformations to the graph of time series, which have more structure than curves due to the inclusion of the temporal dimension.

\begin{abstract}
Analyzing inter-individual variability of physiological functions is particularly appealing in medical and biological contexts to describe or quantify health conditions. Such analysis can be done by comparing individuals to a reference one with time series as biomedical data.
This paper introduces an unsupervised representation learning (URL) algorithm for time series tailored to inter-individual studies. The idea is to represent time series as deformations of a reference time series. The deformations are diffeomorphisms parameterized and learned by our method called TS-LDDMM. Once the deformations and the reference time series are learned, the vector representations of individual time series are given by the parametrization of their corresponding deformation. At the crossroads between URL for time series and shape analysis, the proposed algorithm handles irregularly sampled multivariate time series of variable lengths and provides shape-based representations of temporal data.
In this work, we establish a representation theorem for the graph of a time series and derive its consequences on the LDDMM framework. We showcase the advantages of our representation compared to existing methods using synthetic data and real-world examples motivated by biomedical applications.
