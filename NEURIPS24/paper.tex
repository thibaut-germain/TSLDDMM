% In this paper, we propose an unsupervised representation learning method (URL) for time series \cite{trirat2024universal,meng2023unsupervised} by giving a special attention to their \textit{shapes} for studying inter-variability in biomedical applications.
% In particular, the method handle time series with \textbf{irregular sampling} and \textbf{different sizes}.
% This work belongs to the shape analysis literrature: %which focus on the statistical analysis of various mathematical objects invariant under rotations, dilations, or time parameterization.
%  we extend Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) \cite{beg2005computing,vaillant2004statistics} to the case of time series data by applying difformations to their graph.
% However, time series graph have more structure than 1D curves:
%  a graph time series transformation by a general diffeomorphism is not always a graph time series.
% This work is at the crossroad of URL for time series and shape analysis; we hope it will benefit to both communities.
%A time series is a set of values indexed by time \cite{trirat2024universal}.
%This type of data is prevalent in biology and medicine for recording physiological time series , as well as in the broader context of the Internet of Things sensors \cite{fathy2018large} and measurements in physical systems \cite{luo2021deep}.
 %However, due to the nature of such data, which have different sample sizes and incorporate a temporal evolution, classical statistical analysis, and machine learning methods need refinement \cite{anderson2011statistical}.
 %One option to tackle this issue is to derive a feature representation of time series, which depends on the problem at hand \cite{trirat2024universal}.

 Our goal is to analyze the inter-individual variability within a time series dataset, an approach of prime interest in physiological contexts \cite{guscelli2019importance,wang2016research,bar2012studying,germain2023unsupervised}.
  More specifically, we aim to find an unsupervised features representation method that encodes individual time series specificities compared to a reference one.
In physiology, studying the different \textit{shapes} in a time series related to biological phenomena and their variations according to individual or pathology is common.
However, a \textit{shape} has no clear definition; it is more an intuitive way to speak about the silhouette of a pattern in a time series. In this paper, we refer to as the shape of a time series, the graph of this signal.

Although a community structure with representatives can be learned in an unsupervised way \cite{trirat2024universal,meng2023unsupervised} using contrastive loss \cite{franceschi2019unsupervised,tonekaboni2021unsupervised,meng2023unsupervised} or similarity measures \cite{asgari2023clustering,germain2023unsupervised,paparrizos2015k,ye2009time},
studying the inter-individual variability of shapes within a cluster \cite{niennattrakul2007inaccuracies,shirato2023identifying} is still an open problem in URL and even more for \textit{irregularly sampled} time series with \textit{variable lengths}.
     %In this paper, we aim to go beyond group structure by giving an unsupervised data-driven method that represents the specificity of each individual's shape \cite{vidal2021perceptual}.
  %For instance, the shape of a heartbeat in an Electrocardiogram (ECG) -the pattern- has been well studied \cite{madona2021pqrst} with the PQRST decomposition (see figure\sam{fill}).
  %There exist several methods to detect and segment patterns in a time series (\sam{mettre ref thibuat} ).
   %The goal is then to study their shape according to the property of the individual.

  %  In most clinical studies, depending on expert knowledge, people inspect hand-crafted features such as the mean, wavelets decomposition, or temporal correlation \cite{anderson2011statistical} to keep interpretability.
  %  However, this approach is time-consuming and potentially biased by priors, especially in exploratory research.
  %  Given the success of neural networks \cite{bishop1994neural}, features can now be automatically extracted, depending only on the data, by choosing an objective to optimize and a neural architecture tailored to the problem \cite{ismail2019deep,blazquez2021review,torres2021deep}, even in an unsupervised way \cite{meng2023unsupervised}.
  %  Moreover, depending on the method, it is still possible to have an interpretability of the features.
  %   For instance, among individuals, a contrastive clustering method can be applied to spot community structures \cite{franceschi2019unsupervised,tonekaboni2021unsupervised,meng2023unsupervised}.
  %   More generally, interpretability \cite{yuan2019wave2vec,zhang2018visual,ismail2020benchmarking} is possible by visualizing the shapes of representative patterns to which the model is sensitive.
  %   Other methods, based on similarity measures \cite{asgari2023clustering,germain2023unsupervised,paparrizos2015k}, also propose to perform clustering on shapes in time series or to find some representatives \cite{ye2009time}.

    %Although a community structure with representatives can be learned in an unsupervised way,
    % studying the inter-individual variability of shapes within a cluster \cite{niennattrakul2007inaccuracies,shirato2023identifying} is still an open problem.
     %In this paper, we aim to go beyond group structure by giving an unsupervised data-driven method that represents the specificity of each individual's shape \cite{vidal2021perceptual}.% \thi{In an individual cluster ?}

% Alternatively, one can represent time series with an embedding that can be processed using conventional tools. % or we can represent the time series with an embedding which can be treated by classical tools.

% Depending on the tasks, e.g classification \cite{ismail2019deep}, anomaly detection \cite{blazquez2021review}, forecasting \cite{torres2021deep} or clustering , a meaningful vector representation of time series can be derived.
%  Initially, in this research, handcrafted features were computed from time series, such as the mean, wavelets \cite{percival2000wavelet}, or Fourier coefficients \cite{bloomfield2004fourier}, depending on expert knowledge.
%   However, this approach is time-consuming and potentially biased by priors.
%   Observing the success of neural networks, features are automatically extracted by choosing an objective to optimize and a neural architecture tailored to the problem.
%    Taking a set of time series as input, features can be identified by solving specific supervised tasks—classification \cite{ismail2019deep}, anomaly detection \cite{blazquez2021review}, forecasting \cite{torres2021deep}— or in an unsupervised manner by deriving labels from the inputs \cite{meng2023unsupervised}.
%    \thi{Rajouter une image, et une phrase par rapport au temps}
%    Although the deep learning approach is particularly effective for supervised tasks, annotated datasets are rare, making unsupervised methods more practical.
%    These methods have proven effective in identifying different patterns in the data and providing a vector representation that segregates well into clusters \cite{meng2023unsupervised}.
%     However, they may lack precision on small and homogeneous datasets with only one typical shape, often arising from clinical experiments addressing a specific phenomenon (refer to figures).
%      While current unsupervised methods separate representations into clusters, our focus is on the inter-individual variability within one cluster.
%       Typically, we aim to perform Principal Components Analysis (PCA) \cite{bro2014principal} on individual patterns with similar shapes. The representation is dependant on the input dataset.

%This type of question has already been addressed in shape analysis \cite{vaillant2004statistics}, a community focusing on the statistical analysis of various mathematical objects invariant under rotations, dilations, or time parameterization.
%However, time series data with their specific structure has not been properly adressed.
Our work focuses explicitly on learning shape-based representation of time series. First, we propose not to see the shape of a time series through its curve $\{s_t:\eqsp t\in\msi\}$, but rather through its graph $\msg(s)=\{(t,s(t)):\eqsp t\in \msi\}$.
   Then, building on the shape analysis literature \cite{beg2005computing,vaillant2004statistics}, we follow the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework \cite{beg2005computing,vaillant2004statistics} to analyze these graphs. The idea is to represent each element $\msg(s^j)$ of a dataset $(s^j)_{j\in[N]}$ as the transformation of a reference graph $\msg(\mathbf{s}_0)$ by a diffeomorphism $\phi_j$, i.e. $\msg(s^j) \sim \phi_j . \msg(\mathbf{s}_0)$ .
    The diffeomorphism $\phi_j$ is learned by integrating an ordinary differential equation parameterized by a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).
     The parameters $(\alpha_j)_{j\in[N]}$ encoding the diffemorphisms $(\phi_j)_{j\in[N]}$ yield the representation features of the graphs $(\msg(s^j))_{j\in[N]}$. Finally, these shape-encoding features can feed any statistical or machine-learning model.

%     Finally, these features encoding the shapes can feed any statistical or machine learning model as in URL.

However, a graph time series transformation by a general diffeomorphism is not always a graph time series, see e.g. \Cref{fig:diffeo}, thus a graph time series is more than a simple curve \cite{glaunes2008large}.
 Our contributions arise from this observation: we specify the class of diffeomorphisms to consider and show how to learn them.
  This change is fruitful in representing transformations of time series graphs as illustrated in \Cref{fig:transport}.
   %In this regard, this work is not an application of LDDMM to 1D curves \cite{glaunes2008large}.

     %In particular, the method can handle \textit{irregularly sampled} time series with \textit{variable sizes}.

    %  Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
    %  \begin{itemize}
    %    \item We propose an unsupervised method (TS-LDDMM) to analyze inter-individual variability of shapes in a time series dataset. In particular, the method can handle \textit{irregularly sampled} time series with \textit{variable sizes}.
    %    \item We motivate our extension of LDDMM to time series by introducing a theoretical framework with a representation theorem for time series graph (\Cref{theorem:representation}) and kernels related to their structure (\Cref{lemma:choice_of_kernel_V}).

    %     We illustrate the quantitative interest of the representation on classification tasks on real shape-based datasets.

\section{Related Works}
Shape analysis focuses on statistical analysis of mathematical objects invariant under some deformations like rotations, dilations, or time parameterization.
   The main idea is to represent these objects in a complete Riemannian manifold $(\mathcal{M},\mathbf{g})$ with a metric $\mathbf{g}$ adapted to the geometry of the problem \cite{miller2006geodesic}.
    Then, any set of points in $\mathcal{M}$ can be represented as points in the tangent space of their Frechet mean $\mathbf{m}_0$ \cite{pal2017riemannian,le2001locating} by considering their logarithms.
     The goal is to find a well-suited Riemannian structure according to the nature of the studied object.
     
     LDDMM framework is a relevant shape analysis tool to represent curves as depicted in \cite{glaunes2008large}. However, graphs of time series are a well-structured type of curve due to the inclusion of the temporal dimension that requires specific care (\Cref{fig:diffeo}).
      Closely related, \cite{qiu2009time} tracks anatomical shape changes in serial images using LDDMM but distinguishes from us by including the temporal evolution at a higher level: the goal is to perform longitudinal data modeling.

       Leaving the LDDMM representation, \cite{srivastava2010shape,heo2024logistic} addresses the representation of curves with the Square-Root Velocity (SRV) representation.
        However, the SRV representation is applied after a reparametrization of the temporal dimension on the unit length segment.
         Consequently, the graph structure of the time series is not respected, and the original time evolution of the time series is not encoded in the final representation.
          Very recently, in a functional data analysis framework, a paper \cite{wu2024shape} (Shape-FPCA) improved by representing the original time evolution.
           Nevertheless, this method is made for \textit{continuous objects} and only applies to time series of \textit{same length}, making the estimation more sensitive to noise.
  %However, the case of time series has not been adequately addressed, considering the special attention the time axis requires.
  %For instance, the SRV representation applies after a reparametrization in time, such that the original time evolution of the time series is not represented in the final features.

 %\citet{srivastava2010shape,heo2024logistic} address the representation of curves $C:\msi \to \Rset^d$, $\msi\subset \Rset$, having unitary velocity by using the Square-Root Velocity (SRV) representation.

 Balancing between discrete and continuous elements is a challenging task.
  In the deep learning literature \cite{chen2018neural, kidger2020neural, tzen2019neural, jia2019neural, liu2019neural, ansari2023neural}, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) \cite{chen2018neural} learn continuous latent representations using a vector field parameterized by a neural network, serving as a continuous analogue to Residual Networks \cite{zagoruyko2016wide}.
   This approach was further enhanced by Neural Controlled Differential Equations (Neural CDEs) \cite{kidger2020neural} for handling irregular time series, functioning as continuous-time analogs of RNNs \cite{schuster1997bidirectional}.
 Extending Neural ODEs, Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) introduce regularization effects \cite{liu2019neural}, although optimization remains challenging.
  Leveraging techniques from continuous-discrete filtering theory, Ansari et al. \cite{ansari2023neural} applied succesfully Neural SDEs to irregular time series.
  Oh et al. \cite{oh2024stable} improved these results by incorporating the concept of controlled paths into the drift term, similar to how Neural CDEs outperform Neural ODEs.

\section{Background on LDDMM}
\label{section:LDDMM}

In this part, there is no novelty, we simply expose how to
 learn the diffeomorphisms $(\phi_j)_{j\in[N]}$ using LDDMM, initially introduced in \cite{beg2005computing}.
  In a nutshell, for any $j\in [N]$, $\phi_j$ corresponds to a differential flow related to a learnable velocity field belonging to a well-chosen Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).

  In the next section, the time series are going to be represented by diffeomorphism parameters $(\alpha_j)_{j\in[N]}$.
  That's why LDDMM is chosen since it offers a parametrization for diffemorphisms which is sparse and interpretable, two features particularly relevant in the biomedical context.
 

The basic problem that we consider in this section is the following. Given a set of targets $\mathbf{y}=(y_i)_{i\in[T_2]}$ in $\Rset^{d'}$\footnote{Note that we denote by $d'\in\nset$ the ambient space}, a set of starting points $\mathbf{x}=(x_{i})_{i\in[T_1]}$ in $\Rset^{d'}$, we aim to find a diffeomorphism $\phi$ such that the finite set of points $\mathbf{y}$ is similar in a certain sense to the set of finite sets of transformed points $\phi \cdot \mathbf{x} =(\phi(x_i))_{i\in[T_1]} $.
 The function $\phi$ is occasionally referred to as a \textit{deformation}. In general, these sets $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$ are meshes of continous objects, e.g surfaces, curves, images and so on.

 
% LDDMM is designed to analyzed an existing dataset, while NF and CNF are made to generalize a dataset for data augmentation.
\paragraph{Representing diffeomorpshims as deformations.}
Such \textit{deformations} $\phi$ are constructed via differential flow equations, for any $x_0\in \Rset^{d'} $ and $\tau\in[0,1]$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:LDDMM_dynamic}
    \frac{\dd X(\tau)}{\dd \tau}= v_\tau(X(\tau)), \quad X(0)=x_0\eqsp ,
    \phi^v_\tau(x_0)=X(\tau), \quad \phi^v=\phi^v_1  \eqsp ,
\end{equation}
where the velocity field is $v:\tau\in [0,1]\mapsto v_\tau\in \msv $
and $\msv$ is a Hilbert space of continuously differentiable function
on $\Rset^{d'}$.  If
$||\dd u ||_{\infty}+|| u ||_{\infty}\leq ||u ||_\msv $ for any
$u\in \msv$ and
$v\in \rml^2([0,1],\msv)=\{v\in \rmC^0([0,1],\msv): \int_0^1 ||
v_\tau||^2_\msv \dd \tau<\infty \} $, by \citep[Theorem 5]{glaunes2005transport}
$\phi^v$ exists and belongs to $\mcd(\Rset^{d'})$, where we denote by $\mcd(\mso) $ the set of diffeomorpshim defined on an open set $\mso$ to $\mso$.
 Therefore, for any choice of $v$, $\phi^v$ defines a valid deformation. 
This offers a general recipe to construct diffeomorphism given a functional space $\msv$.

With this in mind, the velocity field $v$ fitting the data can be
estimated by minimizing 
$v \in \rml^2([0,1],\msv) \mapsto \mathscr{L}(\phi^{v}.\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where $\mathscr{L}$ is an appropriate loss function.
 However, two computational challenges arise.
  First, this optimization problem is ill-posed, and a penalty term is needed to obtain a unique solution.
   In addition, we have to find a parametric family $\msv_{\Theta} \subset \rml^2([0,1],\msv)$, parameterized by $\Theta$, which allows us to solve this minimization problem efficiently. 

%\paragraph*{Regularizing the problem to derive uniqueness.}
It has been proposed in \cite{miller2006geodesic} to interpret $\msv$ as a tangent space relative to the group of diffeomorphisms $\msh=\{ \phi^v:\eqsp v\in \rml^2([0,1],\msv)\}$.
Following this geometric point of view, geodesics can be constructed on $\msh$ by using the following squared norm 
 \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:geodesics_original}
    \mathscr{R}^2: g\in \msh\mapsto \inf_{ v\in \rml^2([0,1],\msv):\eqsp g=\phi^v} \int_0^1 || v_\tau||_\msv\dd \tau
 \end{equation}
By deriving differential constraints related to the minimum of \eqref{eq:geodesics_original} and using Cauchy lipshcitz conditions, geodesics can be defined only by giving the starting point and the initial velocity $v_0\in \msv$ \cite{miller2006geodesic}, as straight lines in Euclidean space.
Denoting by $w(v_0)$ the geodesic starting from the identity with inital velocity $v_0$, the exponential map is defined as $\varphi^{\{v_0\}}\triangleq \phi^v$ and the previous matching problem becomes a \textit{geodesic shooting problem}:
 \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:geodesics_shooting}
  \inf_{v_0 \in \msv} \mathscr{L}(\varphi^{\{v_0\}}.\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}).
 \end{equation}
 Using $\varphi^{\{v_0\}}$ instead of $\phi^v$ for any $v\in \rml^2([0,1],\msv)$ regularizes the problem and induces a sparse representation for the learning diffeomorphisms.
 Moreover, by setting $\msv$ as an RKHS, the geodesic shooting problem has a unique solution and becomes tractable, as described in the next section.




% More precisely, on the group of diffeomorphisms $\msh=\{ \phi^v:\eqsp v\in \rml^2([0,1],\msv)\}$,
%  the following squared norm can be defined
%  \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:geodesics_original}
%     \mathscr{R}^2: g\in \msh\mapsto \inf_{ v\in \rml^2([0,1],\msv):\eqsp g=\phi^v} \int_0^1 || v_\tau||_\msv^2\dd \tau
%  \end{equation}
%      as the minimal "energy" needed to perform the deformation $g$.
% By \citep[Theorem 6]{glaunes2005transport}, there exists $v^*\in \rml^2([0,1],\msv)$ such that the previous infimum is a minimum in $v^*$ such that $(\phi^{v^*}_\tau)_{\tau\in[0,1]}$ can be understood as the geodesic between the identity function and $g$.
% However, given a diffeomorphism $g$, computing $\mathscr{R}(g)$ is intractable in most cases. 
% To circumvent this issue, another characterization of geodesics can be considered.
%  As in Riemannian geometry, 
%  instead of defining geodesics from their starting and end points, it is possible to define them from their starting point (here, the identity function) and an initial velocity $v_0\in\msv$.
%  \sam{To CHANGE}
%  %In other words, an Exponential map on deformations is wanted:
% given $v_0\in\msv$, it has been suggested to generate diffeomorphisms as $\varphi^{\{v_0\}}=\phi^v$ with
% %  \begin{equation}
% %   \label{eq:geodesics_shooting}
% %   v=\underset{w\in \rml^2([0,1],\msv):\eqsp w_0=v_0}{\argmin} \int_0^1 || w_\tau||_\msv^2\dd \tau\eqsp ,
% %  \end{equation}
% % since with this definition it holds $\mathscr{R}^2(\phi^v)= \int_0^1 || v_\tau||_\msv^2\dd \tau $.
%  By setting $\msv$ as an RKHS, the geodesic shooting problem \eqref{eq:geodesics_shooting} has a unique solution and becomes tractable, as described in the next section.
% Moreover, we have $\mathscr{R}(\varphi^{\{v_0\}})=||v_0||_\msv$ such that we can work with $v_0\in \msv $ instead of $v\in \rml^2([0,1],\msv)$.
%  Therefore, compared to CNF, only $v_0$ is parametrized by using the geodesic structure and not each $v_\tau$ for any $\tau\in[0,1]$.
%  Moreover, we have $\mathscr{R}(\phi^{\{v_0\}})=||v_0||_\msv$ such that we can work with $v_0\in \msv $ instead of $v\in L^2([0,1],\msv)$.
%  %Therefore, compared to CNF, only $v_0$ is parametrized by using the geodesic structure and not each $v_\tau$ for any $\tau\in[0,1]$.
%  This is presented with more details in the next paragraph.





\paragraph{Discrete parametrization of diffeomorpshim.}
%\alain{adapt this without mentioning applicaiton to time seriess}
%\sam{Est ce qu'on devrait pas introduire la dicretization du graphe ici et dire que l'on peut utiliser le théoreme de représentation}
In this part, $\msv$ is chosen as an RKHS \cite{berlinet2011reproducing} generated by a smooth kernel $K$ (e.g., Gaussian). % $K(x,y)\triangleq \exp(-|x-y|^2/\sigma^2)\operatorname{Id}_{d'}$ for any $(x,y)\in(\Rset^{d'})^2$, where $\sigma^2>0$ is the kernel width and $\operatorname{Id}_{d'}$ is the identity matrix.
We follow \cite{durrleman2013sparse} and define a 
 discrete parameterization of the velocity fields to perform geodesics shooting \eqref{eq:geodesics_shooting}.  
  The initial velocity field $v_0$ is chosen as a finite linear combination of the RKHS basis vector fields, 
$\mathbf{n}_0$ control points $\msx_0=(x_{k,0})_{k\in[\mathbf{n}_0]}\in (\Rset^{d'})^{\mathbf{n}_0}$ and momentum vectors $\alpha_0=(\alpha_{k,0})_{k\in[\mathbf{n}_0]}\in (\Rset^{d'})^{\mathbf{n}_0} $ are defined such that for any $x\in \Rset^{d'}$, 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:def_v0}
    v_0\left(\alpha_0,\msx_0\right)(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{\mathbf{n}_0} K(x,x_{k,0})\alpha_{k,0} \eqsp .
  \end{equation}
   In our applications, the control points $(x_{k,0})_{k\in[\mathbf{n}_0]}$ can be understood as the discretized graph $(t_k,\mathbf{s}_0(t_k))_{k\in[\mathbf{n}_0]}$ of a starting time series $\mathbf{s}_0$. 
  With this parametrization of $v_0$, \citet{miller2006geodesic} show that the velocity field $v$ of the solution of \eqref{eq:geodesics_shooting} keeps the same
  structure along time, such that for any $x\in\Rset^{d'}$ and $\tau\in[0,1]$, 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:specific_form}
    v_\tau(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{\mathbf{n}_0} K(x,x_k(\tau))\alpha_{k}(\tau) \eqsp ,
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation} 
    \label{eq:integration}
      \left\{
        \begin{aligned}
        & \frac{\dd x_k(\tau)}{\dd \tau}=v_\tau(x_k(\tau)) \eqsp, \quad
        \frac{\dd \alpha_k(\tau)}{\dd \tau}=-\sum_{k=1}^{\mathbf{n}_0} \dd_{x_k(\tau)} K(x_k(\tau),x_l(\tau))\alpha_{l}(\tau)^\top \alpha_{k}(\tau) \eqsp  \\
        & \alpha_k(0)=\alpha_{k,0},\quad x_k(0)=x_{k,0} \eqsp , k\in[\mathbf{n}_0] 
        \end{aligned}
        \right .
  \end{equation}
  These equations are derived from the hamiltonian $H:(\alpha_k,x_k)_{k\in [\mathbf{n}_0]}\mapsto \sum_{k,l=1}^{\mathbf{n}_0} \alpha_{k}^\top K(x_k,x_l)\alpha_{l}  $, such that
  the velocity norm is preserved $||v_\tau||_{\msv}=||v_0||_\msv $ for any $\tau\in [0,1]$.
   By \eqref{eq:integration}, the velocity field related to a geodesic $v^*$ is fully parametrized by its initial control points and momentum $(x_{k,0},\alpha_{k,0})_{k\in[\mathbf{n}_0]}$.
   Thus, given a set of targets $\mathbf{y}=(y_i)_{i\in[T_2]}$ in $\Rset^{d'}$, a set of starting points $\mathbf{x}=(x_{i,0})_{i\in[T_1]}$ in $\Rset^{d'}$, a RKHS's kernel $K:\Rset^{d'}\times \Rset^{d'}\to \Rset^{d'\times d'}$, a distance on sets $\mathscr{L}$, 
 a numerical integration scheme of ODE and a penalty factor $\lambda>0$, the basic geodesic shooting step minimizes the following function using a gradient descent method:
   \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:relaxation}
    \mathcal{F}_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}: (\alpha_k)_{k\in [T_1]}\mapsto \mathscr{L}\left(\varphi^{\{v_0\}}.\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right)+\lambda||v_0||_\msv^2 \eqsp,  
   \end{equation}
   where $v_0$ is defined by \eqref{eq:def_v0} and $\varphi^{\{v_0\}}.\mathbf{x}$ is the result of the numerical integration of \eqref{eq:integration} using control points $\mathbf{x}$ and initial momentums $(\alpha_k)_{k\in[T_1]} $. 



   %Before to specify the choice of the RKHS kernel $K$ and the loss on sets $\mathscr{L}$ in \Cref{section:time_series_specificity}, we first discuss the connection of LDDMM with normalizing flows. % to highlight the interest of the LDDMM approach.


  
   
%Conversely to NF or CNF, by \eqref{eq:integration}, different momentums parameters raise different final deformations $\phi^{\{v_0\}}$, this injectivity properties offers interpretability of the representation and gives sens to PCA or LDA post-processing as exposed in \Cref{section:experiments}.
  
   %If a diffeomorpshim $\Phi$ is given and we want to represent it as a deformation $\phi^v$ with $v$ of minimal ernergy, then
  %$(\alpha_{k,0})_k$ is the only parameters to learn since $(x_{k,0})_k$ is fixed.

\paragraph{Relation to Continuous Normalizing Flows.}

One particular popular choice to address the problem of learning a diffeomorphism or a velocity field is Normalizing Flows \cite{rezende2015variational,kobyzev2020normalizing} (NF) or their continuous counterpart \cite{chen2018neural,grathwohl2019scalable,salman2018deep} (CNF).
However, we do not rely on this class of learning algorithms for several reasons. Indeed, existing and simple normalizing flows are not suitable for the type of data that we are interested in this paper \cite{feng2023multi,deng2020modeling}. 
  In addition,  they are primarily designed to have tractable Jacobian functions, while we do not require such property in our applications. 
Finally, the use of a differential flow solution of an ODE
\eqref{eq:LDDMM_dynamic} trick is also at the basis of CNF, which
then consists of learning a velocity field to address in fitting the data through a loss aiming to address the problem
at hand. Nevertheless, the main difference between CNF and LDDMM lies in the
parametrization of the velocity field. LDDMM uses kernels to
derive closed form formula and enhance interpretability while
NF and CNF take advantage of deep neural networks to scale with
large dataset in high dimensions.
\section{Methodology}
%\paragraph{Assumptions}
%Denoting by $C^0(\msi,\msj) $ the space of continous functions between two sets $\msi,\msj$,

We consider in this paper observations which consist in a population of $N$ multivariate time series, for any $j\in[N]$, $s^j \in \rmC^1(\msi_j,\Rset^{d})$. 
However, we can only access a $n_j$-samples $\tsig^j=(\tsig_i^j=s^j(t^j_i))_{i\in[n_j]}$ collected at timestamps $(t^j_i)_{i\in[n_j]}$ for any $j \in [N]$.
 Note that \textbf{the number of samples $n_j$ is not necessary the same accross individuals} and the timestamps can be \textbf{irregularly sampled}.
%To ease the presentation of our methodology, we suppose that we have access to the continuous time series $(s^j)_{j\in[N]}$, while in practice, we can only access a $n_j$-samples $\tsig^j=(\tsig_i^j=s^j(t^j_i))_{i\in[n_j]}$ collected at timestamps $(t^j_i)_{i\in[n_j]}$ for any $j \in [N]$.
 %However, this difference does not change the overall rationale of our method and its implementation up to minor changes, which we summarize in \eqref{eq:general_optimization_problem}.
 We assume the time series population is globally homogeneous regarding their "shapes" even if inter-individual variability exists.
 Intuitively speaking, the "shape" of a time series $s:\msi\to \Rset^d$ is encoded in its graphs $\msg(s)$ defined as the set $\{(t,s(t)):\eqsp t\in\msi \} $ and not only in its values $s(\msi)=\{s(t):\eqsp t\in\msi \} $ since the time axis is crucial. % on the shape as illustrated in Figure\alain{ (mettre ref)}.
 As a motivating use-case, $s^j$ can be the time series of a heartbeat extracted from an individual's electrocardiogram (ECG), see \Cref{fig:transport}.
 The homogeneity in a resulting dataset comes from the fact that humans have similar shapes of heartbeat \cite{ye2012heartbeat,madona2021pqrst}.
 % the shape is also referred as morphology of the time series. 
  %  [More specifically, the heterogeneity in such dataset is often due to local or glocal dilatation of the time series regarding time, the heartbeat is quicker or slower depending on the individual.
  %  In maths, denoting by $\mcd(\msi,\msj) $ the set of diffeomorpshim defined on the sets $\msi$ to $\msj$,
  %   there exist a common pattern $\mathbf{s}_0: \msi \to \Rset^d$ and individual time reparametrisations $ \psi_j\in\mcd(\msi,\msi_j) $ such that,
  %   for any $j\in[N]$, $s^j=\mathbf{s}_0\circ \psi_j^{-1} $.]
%  \paragraph{Goals}%\sam{potentiellement changer l'ordre de time and space}
\paragraph*{The deformation problem.}
In this paper, we aim to study the inter-individual variability in the dataset by finding a relevant representation of each time series.
Inspired from the framework of shape analysis \cite{vaillant2004statistics}, addressing similar problems in morphology,
 we suggest to represent each time series' graph $\msg(s^j)$ as the transformation of a reference graph $\msg(\mathbf{s}_0)$, related to a time series $\mathbf{s}_0:\msi \to\Rset^d$, by a diffeomorphism $\phi_j$ on $\Rset^{d+1}$, for any $j\in[N]$,
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:transformation}
 \phi_j.\msg(\mathbf{s}_0)=\{\phi_j\left(t,\mathbf{s}_0(t)\right), \eqsp t\in \msi \} \eqsp.
\end{equation}
$\bfs_0$ will be understood as the typical representative shape common to the collection of time series $(s^j)_{j\in[N]}$.
As $\bfs_0$ is supposed to be fixed, then the representation of the time series $(s^j)_{j\in[N]}$ boils down to the one of the transformation $(\phi_j)_{j\in[N]}$.
We aim to learn $\msg(\bfs_0)$ and $(\phi_j)_{j\in[N]} $. 

%First, we introduce the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework.
% Then, we explain how to learn a discretization of the graph $\msg(\bfs_0)$ and the diffeomorphisms $(\phi_j)_{j\in[N]} $ by using LDDMM and a gradient descent minimization.
  %Finally, we tackle the specificity of graph time series by deriving a representation theorem on diffeomorphisms, which enables us to select the kernel needed in LDDMM, and thus, we propose TS-LDDMM.

     \paragraph{Optimization related to \eqref{eq:transformation}.}
     Defining the \textit{discretized graphs} of the time series $(s^j)_{j\in[N]}$ and a discretization of the reference graph $\msg(\mathbf{s}_0)$  as, for any $j\in[N]$,
     \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:descretized_graph}
      \mathbf{y}_j=\msg(\tsig^j)=(t_i^j,\tsig^j_i)_{ i\in[n_j]}\in (\Rset^{d+1})^{n_j},\quad \tilde{\msg}_0=(t_i^0,\tsig^0_i)_{i\in[\mathbf{n}_0]}\in (\Rset^{d+1})^{\mathbf{n}_0} \eqsp ,
     \end{equation}
       with $\mathbf{n}_0=\operatorname{median}((n_j)_{j\in[N]})$, the representation problem given in \eqref{eq:transformation} boils down solving:
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:general_optimization_problem}
        \argmin_{\tilde{\msg}_0,(\alpha_k^j)_{k\in [\mathbf{n}_0]}^{j\in[N]}} \sum_{j=1}^N \mathcal{F}_{\tilde{\msg}_0,\mathbf{y}_j}\left((\alpha_k^j)_{k\in [\mathbf{n}_0]}\right)\eqsp ,
      \end{equation}
      which is carried out by a gradient descent on the control points $\tilde{\msg}_0$ and the momentums $\mathbf{\alpha}_j=(\alpha_k^j)_{k\in [\mathbf{n}_0]}$ for any $j\in[N]$, initialized by a dataset's time series graph of size $\mathbf{n}_0$ and by $0_{(d+1)\mathbf{n}_0}$ respectively.
      The optimization hyperparameter details are given in \Cref{appendix:optimizers_details}.
     The result of the minimization $\tilde{\msg}_0$ is then considered as the $\mathbf{n}_0$-samples of a common time series $\mathbf{s}_0$ and the momentums $\mathbf{\alpha}_j$ encoding $\phi_j$ yields a feature vector in $\Rset^{d \mathbf{n}_0} $ of $s^j$ for any $j\in[N]$.
     %, which will be the representation of the time series when choosing the time series' graph sets as inputs, is dependent on the choice of kernel $K$ and the set distance $L$.
     Finally, the vectors $(\mathbf{\alpha}_j)_{j\in[N]}$ can be analyzed with any statistical or machine learning tools such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Latent Discriminant Analysis (LDA), longitudinal data analysis and so on.
%As $\bfs_0$ is supposed to be fixed, then the representation of the time series $(s_j)_{j\in[N]}$ boils down to the one of the transformation $(\phi_j)_{j\in[N]}$.
 %In \Cref{section:optimization} the choice of the common time series $\mathbf{s}_0$ will be optimized to have $\phi_j$ of minimal norm. %T is given in the following part.

%  To learn the diffeomorphisms $(\phi_j)_{j\in[N]}$, we propose to use in this paper Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM).
%   In a nutshell, for any $j\in [N]$, $\phi_j$ corresponds to a differential flow related to a learnable velocity field belonging to a well-chosen Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).
% We now describe more precisely LDDMM and in a next step the procedure to learn $\mathbf{s}_0$.

% \sam{to improve ?}
% Compared to the litterature of Unsupervised Representation Learning (URL) \cite{meng2023unsupervised}, the homogeneity assumption can be quite restrictive, however this is quite common in Shape Analysis \cite{vaillant2004statistics} (SA).
%     While in URL the goal is to find features accounting for the clustering structure in the heterogene data and to transfer this representation for different ML tasks, in SA the goal is to analyze the inter-individual variability with precision to derive clinical conclusions.
%     The generalization of the method presented in this paper to heterogene dataset is possible, but relagated for future works.
  %These velocity fields are then learned by minimizing the norm of this RKHS.

%In all the following, we denote by $\mcd(\mso) $ the set of diffeomorpshim defined on an open set $\mso$ to $\mso$.

   \subsection{Application of LDDMM to time series analysis: TS-LDDMM}
%\tcr{Mettre l'applicaiton clair pour les times series}

        \label{section:time_series_specificity}
        In this section, we present our theoretical contribution: we tailor the LDDMM framework to handle time series data.
          The reason is that applying a general diffeomorphism $\phi$ from $\Rset^{d+1}$ to a time series' graph $\msg(s)$ can result in a set $\phi.\msg(s)$ that does not correspond to the graph of any time series, as illustrated in the \Cref{fig:diffeo}.
           Thus, Time series graph have more structure than a simple 1D curve \cite{glaunes2008large} and deserve their special analysis which will prove fruitful as demonstrated in \ref{section:experiments}.% thus this case is not an application of \cite{glaunes2004diffeomorphic}

To address this challenge, we need to identify an RKHS kernel $K:\Rset^{d+1}\times \Rset^{d+1}\to \Rset^{(d+1)^2}$ that generates deformations preserving the structure of the time series graph. This goal motivates us to clarify, in \Cref{theorem:representation}, the specific representation of diffeomorphisms we require before presenting a class of kernels that produce deformations with this representation.

Similarly, selecting a loss function on sets $\mathscr{L}$ that considers the temporal evolution in a time series' graph is crucial for meaningful comparisons with time series data. Consequently, we introduce the oriented Varifold distance. 
      
       \paragraph{A representation separating space and time.}
       We prove that two time series graphs can always be linked by a time transformation composed of a space transformation. Moreover, a time series graph transformed by this kind of transformation is always a time series graph.
        We define $\Psi_\gamma\in \mcd(\Rset^{d+1}) : (t,x)\in\Rset^{d+1}\to (\gamma(t),x)$ for any $\gamma\in \mcd(\Rset)$ and $\Phi_f:  (t,x)\in\Rset^{d+1}\to (t,f(t,x)) $ for any $f\in \rmC^1(\Rset^{d+1},\Rset^d)$. 
        We have the following representation theorem.
        All proofs are given in \Cref{appendix:proofs}. 


  Denote by $\msg(s)\triangleq \{ (t,s(t)): \eqsp t\in \msi \} $ the graph of a time series $s: \msi \to \Rset^d$ and $ \phi.\msg(s)\triangleq\{ \phi(t,s(t)): \eqsp t\in \msi\} $ the action of  $\phi\in \mcd(\Rset^{d+1}) $ on $\msg(s)$.
    \begin{theorem}
        \label{theorem:representation}
    Let $s:  \msj \to \Rset^d  $ and $\mathbf{s}_0: \msi\to \Rset^d $ be two continuously differentiable time seriess with $\msi,\msj$ two intervals of $\Rset$.
     There exist $f\in \rmC^1(\Rset^{d+1},\Rset^d)$ and $\gamma\in  \mcd(\Rset) $ such that $\gamma(\msi)=\msj $ and $\Phi_f\in \mcd(\Rset^{d+1})$,
     \begin{equation}
        \msg(s)= \Pi_{\gamma,f}.\msg(\mathbf{s}_0),\eqsp \Pi_{\gamma,f}=\Psi_\gamma\circ\Phi_f.
     \end{equation}
     Moreover, for any $\bar{f}\in \rmC^1(\Rset^{d+1},\Rset^d)$ and $\bar{\gamma}\in  \mcd(\Rset) $, there exists a continously differentiable time series $\bar{s}$ such that 
     $\msg(\bar{s})= \Pi_{\bar{\gamma},\bar{f}}.\msg(\mathbf{s}_0)$
    \end{theorem}

    % \begin{proof}
    %   Let $s:  \msj \to \Rset^d  $ and $\mathbf{s}_0: \msi\to \Rset^d $ be two continuously differentiable time seriess with $\msi=(a,b),\msj=(\alpha,\beta)$ two intervals of $\Rset$.
    %   % $\msg(\mathbf{s}_0)$ and $\msg(s)$ are two smooth connected 1-dimensional manifold of $\Rset^{d+1}$, thus, by \cite[Appendix
    %   % Classfying 1-Manifolds]{milnor1965topology}, there exists $\Pi\in \mcd(\Rset^{d+1})$ such that $\msg(s)=\Pi.\msg(\mathbf{s}_0)$.
    %   %  Therefore, denoting by $\Pi_1: \Rset^{d+1}\mapsto \Rset$, we define $\gamma(t)\triangleq \Pi_1(t,\mathbf{s}_0(t))$ for any $t\in \msi$, then for any $t\in [b,+\infty)$,
    %   %   \begin{equation}

    %   %   and for any $t\in (-\infty,a]$,
    %   %   \begin{equation}

    %   %   \end{equation}
    %   %    where $ \frac{\dd\gamma}{\dd^- t},\frac{\dd\gamma}{\dd^+ t}$ are respectively the left and right derivative.
        
    %   By setting $\gamma: t\in \Rset \mapsto (\beta-\alpha)(t-a)/(b-a)+\alpha\in \Rset $, we have $ \gamma(\msi)=\msj$ and $\gamma \in \mcd(\Rset) $.

    %     indeed, its inverse is $\Phi_f^{-1}:(t,x)\in\Rset^{d+1}\mapsto (t,x+\mathbf{s}_0(t)-s(t)) $ and is continuously differentiable.
    %      Moreover, we have $\Pi_{\gamma,f}.\msg(\mathbf{s}_0)=\{(\gamma(t),s\circ \gamma(t)):\eqsp t\in\msi \}=\msg(s) $.

        

    %     Let $\bar{f}\in \rmC^0(\Rset^{d+1},\Rset^d)$, $\bar{\gamma}\in  \mcd(\Rset) $ and $\mathbf{s}_0\in \rmC^0(\msi,\Rset^d)$ with $\msi$ an interval of $\Rset$.
    %     We have :

    %     By defining $\bar{s}:t\in \gamma(\msi)\to f\left(\gamma^{-1}(t),\mathbf{s}_0(\gamma^{-1}(t))\right) $, we have $\bar{s}\in \rmC^0(\gamma(\msi), \Rset^d) $ by composition of continuous functions
    %     and $ \msg(\bar{s})= \Pi_{\gamma,f}.\msg(\mathbf{s}_0)$ by \eqref{eq:proof1_last_eq}, which concludes the proof.

    \paragraph{Choice for the kernel associated with the RKHS $\msv$}
    \label{paragraph:kernel_V}
    As depicted on \Cref{fig:diffeo}-\ref{fig:transport}, we can not use any kernel $K$ to apply the previous methodology to learn deformations on time series' graphs.
    We describe and motivate our choice in this paragraph.
     Denote the one-dimensional Gaussian kernel by $K_\sigma^{(a)}(x,y)=\exp(-|x-y|^2/\sigma)$ for any $(x,y)\in (\Rset^a)^2$, $a\in \Nset$ and $\sigma>0$.
    To solve the geodesic shooting problem \eqref{eq:relaxation} on $\Rset^{d+1}$, we consider for $\msv$ the RKHS associated with the kernel defined for any $(t,x),(t',x')\in (\Rset^{d+1})^2$:
    \begin{align}
      \label{eq:kernel_TAS}
      &K_{\msg}((t,x),(t',x'))=\begin{pmatrix}
        c_0K_{\text{time}} & 0 \\
        0 & c_1 K_{\text{space}} 
        \end{pmatrix} \eqsp ,\\
       & K_{\text{space}}=K_{\sigma_{T,1}}^{(1)}(t,t')K_{\sigma_x}^{(d)}(x,x') \Idd\eqsp,K_{\text{time}}=K_{\sigma_{T,0}}^{(1)}(t,t') \eqsp,
    \end{align}
    parametrized by the widths $\sigma_{T,0},\sigma_{T,1},\sigma_x>0$ and the constants $c_0,c_1>0$.
This choice for $K_\msg$ is motivated by the representation \Cref{theorem:representation} and the following result. 
    \begin{lemma}
      \label{lemma:choice_of_kernel_V}
      If we denote by $\msv$ the RKHS associated with the kernel $K_{\msg}$, then for any vector field $v$ generated by \eqref{eq:integration} with $v_0$ satisfying \eqref{eq:def_v0},
       there exist $\gamma \in \msd(\Rset) $ and $f\in \rmC^1(\Rset^{d+1},\Rset^d)$ such that $\phi^v=\Psi_\gamma\circ\Phi_f $.
    \end{lemma}
    \sam{Parler des Cauchy kernel en appndice et du choix de la loss}
    % \begin{proof}
    %   Let $v$ be a vector field generated by \eqref{eq:integration} with $v_0$ satisfying \eqref{eq:def_v0}.
    %  We remark that the first coordinate of the velocity field $v_\tau$ denoted by $v_\tau^{\text{time}}$ only depends on the time variable $t$ for any $\tau\in[0,1]$.
    %  Thus, when computing the first coordinate of the deformation $\phi^v$, denoted by $\gamma$, we integrate \eqref{eq:LDDMM_dynamic} with $v_\tau$ replaced by $v_\tau^{\text{time}}$,
    %   thus $\gamma$ is independant of the variable $x$. Moreover, $\gamma\in \mcd(\Rset)$ since a Gaussian kernel induced an Hilbert space $\msv$ satisfying $|f|_V\leq |f|_\infty+ |\dd f|_\infty  $ for any $f\in \msv$ by \citep[Theorem 9]{glaunes2005transport}.
    %   For the same reason, we have $\phi^v\in \mcd(\Rset^{d+1})$, and thus its last coordinates denoted by $f$ belongs to $\rmC^1(\Rset^{d+1},\Rset^d)$, and by construction $\phi^v=\Psi_\gamma\circ\Phi_f $.
    % \end{proof
    \begin{remark}
      With this choice of kernel, the features associated to the time transformation can be extracted from the momentums $(\alpha_{k,0})_{k\in[\mathbf{n}_0]}\in (\Rset^{d+1})^{\mathbf{n}_0}$ in \eqref{eq:def_v0} by taking the coordinates related to time.
      However, the features related to the space transformation are not only in the space coordinates since the related kernel $K_{\text{space}}$ depends on time as well.
     \end{remark}
    In \Cref{appendix:kernel_TS_LDDMM}, we give guidelines for selecting the hyperparameters $(\sigma_{T,0},\sigma_{T,1},\sigma_x,c_0,c_1)$.
  
  
    

    %  and then we can perform a statistical analysis on the representations $(\psi_j,\phi^j)_{j\in[N]}$,
    % such as applying PCA decomposition \cite{vaillant2004statistics}, carring out longitudinal analysis \cite{guigui2022parallel} and so on (\sam{mettre ref}).

%and their empiric samples version $\tilde{G}_j=(\{(t_i,s^j_i), \eqsp i\in [n_i]\})_j $

%  We translate the notation from the continous to discrete by adding a tilde :
%   $\tilde{G}^j=\triangleq \{ (t_i,\tilde{s}_i^j),\eqsp i\in[n_i] \}$.

% \paragraph{A problem of minimization}
% In the next section, we will present that diffeomorpshim on space an time can be parametrized as $\phi^{v^S},\phi^{v^T}$
%  with parameters $(v^S,v^T) \in \Theta_S\times \Theta_T$. Then, pattern will be represented by the parameters $v^S,v^T$ solutions of the following minimization :
% \begin{align}
%   \label{eq:minimization}
%   &\argmin_{v^S \in \Theta_S,\eqsp v^T\in \Theta_T } \mathbf{D}(v^S,v^T)+\lambda \mathbf{N}(v^S,v^T)\eqsp , \\
%   & \mathbf{D}(v^S,v^T)=L(\phi^{v^S}.G^\msj(\mathbf{s_0}\circ (\psi^{v^T})^{-1}),G^\msj(s)) \eqsp , 
% \end{align} 
% where $L$ is a loss on graphs and $\mathbf{N}$ is a term of regularization.

 


% $s_i: t\in[0,T_0]\mapsto s(t)\in \Rset^d $ is only known through its samples $(S_i^j(t_i)=s_i)_{i\in[N]} $ at timestamps $(t_i)_{i\in[T]}$.

%\sam{améliorer transition}
\paragraph{Loss}

This section specifies the distance function $\scrl$ introduced in the loss function defined in \eqref{eq:relaxation}. 

In practice, we can only access discretized graphs of time series, $(t_i^j,\tsig^j_i)_{i\in[n_j]}$ for any $j\in[N]$, that are potentially of 
different sizes $n_j$ and sampled at different timestamps $(t_i^j)_{i\in[n_j]}$ for any $j\in[N]$.
 Usual metrics, such as the Euclidean distance, are not appealing as they 
make the underlying assumptions of equal size sets and the existence of a pairing between points.
 Distances between measures on 
sets (taking the empirical distribution), such as Maximum Mean Discaprency (MMD) \cite{dziugaite2015training,borgwardt2006integrating}, alleviate those issues; however, MMD only accounts for positional information 
and lacks information about the time evolution between sampled points.
 A classical data fidelity metric from shape analysis 
corresponding to the distance between \textit{oriented varifolds} associated with curves alleviates this last issue \cite{kaltenmark2017general}.  
Intuitively, an oriented varifold is a measure that accounts for positional and tangential information about the underlying 
curves at sample points. More details and information about \textit{oriented varifolds} can be found in \Cref{appendix:varifold}. 

More precisely, given two sets $\msg_0=(g_i^0)_{i\in[T_0]},\msg_1=(g_i^1)_{i\in[T_1]}\in (\Rset^{d+1})^{T_1}$ and a kernel\footnote{$\mathbb{S}^d=\{x\in\Rset^{d+1}:\eqsp |x|=1\}$} $k:(\Rset^{d+1} \times \mathbb{S}^d)^2\to \Rset$
verifying \citep[Proposition 2 \& 4]{kaltenmark2017general}, for any $\xi\in\{0,1\}$ and $i\in[T_\xi-1]$, denoting the center and length of the $i^{th}$ segment $[g_i^\xi,g_{i+1}^\xi]$ by
$c_i^\xi = (g_i^\xi + g_{i+1}^\xi)/2$, $l_i^\xi = \| g_{i+1}^\xi-g_{i}^\xi\|$, and 
$\overrightarrow{v_i}^\xi = (g_{i+1}^\xi-g_{i}^\xi)/l_i^\xi$, the varifold distance between $\msg_0$ and $\msg_1$  is defined as,
\begin{align}
  &d_{\msw^*}^2(\msg_0,\msg_1) = \sum_{i,j = 1}^{T_0-1}l^0_i k((c^0_i,\overrightarrow{v_i}^0),(c^0_j,\overrightarrow{v_j}^0))l^0_j
  - 2 \sum_{i=1}^{T_0-1}\sum_{j=1}^{T_1-1}l^0_i k((c^0_i,\overrightarrow{v_i}^0),(c^1_j,\overrightarrow{v_j}^1))l^1_j \\
  &+ \sum_{i,j = 1}^{T_1-1}l^1_i k((c^1_i,\overrightarrow{v_i}^1),(c^1_j,\overrightarrow{v_j}^1))l^1_j 
\end{align}

In practice, we set the kernel $k$ as the product of two anisotropic Gaussian kernels, $k_{\pos}$ and $k_{\dir}$, 
such that for any $(x,\overrightarrow{u}),(y,\overrightarrow{v}) \in (\Rset^{d+1} \times \mathbb{S}^d)^2$
\begin{equation}
    k((x,\overrightarrow{u}),(y,\overrightarrow{v})) = k_{\pos}(x,y)k_{\dir}(\overrightarrow{u},\overrightarrow{v}) \eqsp.
  \end{equation}
  The specific kernels $k_{\pos},k_{\dir}$ that we use in our experiments are given \Cref{appendix:kernel_implementation}.
   Note that the loss kernel $k$ has nothing to do with the velocity field kernel denoted by $K_\msg$ or $K$ specified in \Cref{paragraph:kernel_V}.
Finally, we define the data fidelity loss function, $\scrl$, as $ d_{\msw^*}^2$, which is differentiable with regards to its first variable.
For further readings on curves and surfaces representation as varifolds, readers can refer to \cite{kaltenmark2017general,charon2013varifold}.

%To relax the geodesic problem \Cref{eq:geodesics_original}, the end point of the geodesics is compared to the target through a loss $\mathscr{L}$ as proposed in \eqref{eq:relaxation}.
%Since we are dealing with discrete time series $\tsig^j$ of different samples size $n_j$, we need a loss on set measures and not only on vectors.
% A natural choice would be the Maximum Mean Discrepency (MMD) \cite{dziugaite2015training,borgwardt2006integrating}, for any $X=(x_i)_{i\in[T_1]},Y=(y_i)_{i\in[T_2]}\subset Rset^{d'}$, given a kernel $k:\Rset^{d'}\times \Rset^{d'} \to \Rset$,
% \begin{align}
%  &\operatorname{MMD}^k(\mu_X,\mu_Y)=\frac{1}{T_1^2}\sum_{i,j=1}^{T_1} k(x_i,x_j)+\frac{1}{T_2^2}\sum_{i,j=1}^{T_2} k(y_i,y_j) \\
%  &-\frac{2}{T_1T_2}\sum_{i=1}^{T_1}\sum_{j=1}^{T_2} k(x_i,y_j) \eqsp , 
% \end{align}
% where $\mu_X=\sum_{i=1}^{T_1} \delta_{x_i}/T_1$, $\mu_Y=\sum_{j=1}^{T_2} \delta_{y_j}/T_2$.
%However, this distance is agnostic of the time evolutions in time series' graph $(t_i^j,\tsig^j_i)_{i\in[n_j]}$, there is no orientation of the set taken into account.
% That is why, we prefer to choose the Varifold distance $d_V(\cdot,\cdot)$ \cite{kaltenmark2017general} which was specifically designed for oriented curves.
%  The Varifold distance extends the MMD by adding tangent vectors to the input:
%   instead of considering a set $X=(x_i)_{i\in[T_1]}$, we extend the input as $\overrightarrow{X}=(x_i,v_i)_{i\in[T_1]}$ where $v_i$ is the tangent vector at $x_i$ such that
%    \begin{equation}
%      d_V(X,Y)=\operatorname{MMD}^{K_p}(\mu_{\overrightarrow{X}},\mu_{\overrightarrow{X}}) \eqsp ,
%    \end{equation}
%    where in practice the tangent vectors are taken as discrete derivative and $K_p$ is a kernel on $\Rset^{2d'}$ such that for any $(x,v),(y,w)\in (\Rset^{2d})^2$, 
%    we have, 
%    \begin{equation}
%      K_p((x,v),(y,w))=k(x,v)k_T(v,w) \eqsp ,
%    \end{equation}
%   where $k_T $ is a kernel on the tangent vector space.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a feature representation method, TS-LDDMM, designed for 
shape comparison in homogeneous time series datasets. We show on a real dataset 
its ability to study, with high interpretability, the inter-individual shape 
variability. As an unsupervised approach, it is user-friendly and enables knowledge 
transfer for different supervised tasks such as classification. Although TS-LDDMM 
is already competitive for classification, its performances can be leveraged on 
more heterogeneous datasets using a hierarchical clustering extension, which is relagated for future work. 

%\section{Societal impact}
%This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.
